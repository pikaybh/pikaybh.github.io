In order for the hazard and risk prevention plan system to ensure on-site operability and effectiveness in preventing accidents at construction sites, the operation system of the plan must be useful without imposing an excessive burden in practice, from the drafting and submission process to review and verification.
Therefore, this study aims to analyze the effectiveness of the hazard and risk prevention plan by conducting a literature review on pre-safety evaluation systems both domestically and internationally, analyzing the actual conditions of sites subject to hazard and risk prevention plans, and investigating the current operation status of similar systems in Korea, with the goal of proposing measures to enhance its substance.

유해·위험방지계획서 제도가 건설현장의 재해예방에 있어서 현장 작동성과 실효성을 확보하기 위해서는, 작성·제출, 심사·확인의 전 과정에 이르기까지 제도의 운용 체계가 유용성을 가지면서도 실무적으로 과중한 부담에 이르지 않도록 해야 한다.
따라서 본 연구에서는 국내·외 사전안전성 평가 제도 관련 문헌조사, 유해·위험방지계획서 대상 현장 실태분석, 국내 유사 제도 운영 현황 조사를 통해 유해·위험방지계획서의 실효성을 분석하고, 내실화 방안을 마련하고자 한다.
