<!--
I am a Master's degree student at [Seoul National University](https://snu.ac.kr/){: target="_blank"}. 
I received my B.S. degree from [Dankook University](https://dankook.ac.kr/){: target="_blank"} in 2023, respectively.
I am currently located in Seoul, Korea, and work as a researcher in [Seoul National University Construction Engineering & Management Lab. (SNUCEM)](https://cem.snu.ac.kr/){: target="_blank"}.
My research interests include Construction Management and Large Language Model (LLM). 
As long-term practical goals, I would develop LLM based construction worker safety management program.

I am a Ph.D. researcher at [Seoul National University (SNU)](https://snu.ac.kr/){: target="_blank"}.
I received my bachelor's degree from [Dankook University](https://dankook.ac.kr/){: target="_blank"} in 2023 and my master's degree from [SNU](https://snu.ac.kr/){: target="_blank"} in 2025, respectively. 
I am currently located in Seoul, Korea, and work as a researcher in [Seoul National University Construction Engineering & Management Lab. (SNUCEM)](https://cem.snu.ac.kr/){: target="_blank"}.

My research focuses on leveraging LLMs to automate tasks in construction engineering and management.
Recently, I conducted research on this topic and published a paper.
